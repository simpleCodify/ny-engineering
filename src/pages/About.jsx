							<p>We are a structural engineering firm that has been in business since 2004. Our projects encompass a wide range with the majority being residential and low rise commercial construction. We are a firm sized to allow participation by the principal in virtually all aspects of all projects. Our clients are predominantly architects, developers, design-build contractors, and property owners.</p>
							<p>Our design approach is to have a collaborative effort between the client, architect, and contractors. Our principle is that we want to solve problems that arise, not to create project obstructions. Our goal is to provide an economical solution to designs that push the envelope rather than compromise a design with over-engineering.</p>
							<p>
								Our firm is known for its attention to detail and careful project management. Our experienced professionals are trained to apply creative and cost-effective solutions. Utilizing top-level teamwork and technical expertise, we try to bring the client a cost-effective and unique solution to their engineering needs. We enjoy the fact that our clients return again and again and we cherish building these personal relationships. Our engineers are trained to combine the
								right mixture of technical and practical skills to apply building code requirements with an imagination and engineering judgment rarely applied by others.
							</p>
							<p>We understand the importance of sound structural design that facilitates construction with high- performance execution. Thus, we never forget to take the importance of engineering as a service profession and always provide a reliable product in a reasonable response time. We are the firm that people come to when they want something done right the first time, every time.</p>
